    "MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that uses a flexible, JSON-like format to store data. Itâ€™s designed for ease\n",
    "of development and scaling, making it perfect for handling large volumes of unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, offer a flexible and scalable approach to data management, compared\n",
    "to traditional relational (SQL) databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less: They don't require a fixed schema, allowing for dynamic changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal Scalability: They can distribute data across multiple servers, handling large data volumes efficiently.\n",
    "Variety of Data Models: They support document, key-value, wide-column, and graph data models, each suited for different\n",
    "                        types of applications.\n",
    "\n",

    "Rapid Development: When you want flexibility in schema design and fast iteration during development without dealing\n",

    "Complex Data Structures: When your application works with complex data structures that don't fit well into tabular formats.\n",
    "Geographically Distributed Data: If your application requires data to be distributed across multiple locations for\n",

    "Document-Oriented Storage:\n",
    "MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents. This makes the data structure more intuitive and flexible compared to\n",
    "traditional rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-Less:\n",
    "You can store documents with varying structures in the same collection. This flexibility allows for rapid development\n",
    "and iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, which distributes data across multiple servers, ensuring high\n",
    "performance and availability as data grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing:\n",
    "Indexes can be created to improve the performance of queries. This includes primary, secondary, geospatial, and text indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication:\n",
    "MongoDB offers high availability through replica sets. A replica set consists of two or more copies of the data, which\n",
    "ensures data redundancy and failover capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation Framework:\n",
    "MongoDB provides powerful aggregation operations like filtering, grouping, and transformation of data. This is useful\n",
    "for generating analytics and reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ad Hoc Queries:\n",
    "You can perform a wide range of queries on the data, including search by field, range queries, and regular expression\n",

    "Load Balancing:\n",
    "Built-in load balancing distributes workload across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck.\n",

    "File Storage:\n",
    "MongoDB has GridFS for storing and retrieving large files, such as images or videos, efficiently.\n",
